According to our notes, the following things matter in creating a safety score:
-Lighting
-Eyes on the street - open businesses, residences, cameras, etc.
-Historic crime data
-Foot traffic
-What's the average wait time for transportation arrival?
-Is the waiting area obscured from public view?
-What kind of street furniture is provided?
-How often is the area patrolled by public safety officers?

So, where can we get data on how to quanitfy these things?
