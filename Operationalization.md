According to our notes, the following things matter in creating a safety score:

1. Lighting
2. Eyes on the street - open businesses, residences, cameras, etc.
3. Historic crime data
4. Foot traffic
5. What's the average wait time for transportation arrival?
6. Is the waiting area obscured from public view?
7. What kind of street furniture is provided?
8. How often is the area patrolled by public safety officers?

So, where can we get data on how to quanitfy these things?

1. 
2.  - Business License filings https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Legally-Operating-Businesses/w7w3-xahh
    - Yelp API https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/business
3.  Crime:
    - [NYC OpenData: NYPD Complaint Data Historic](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i)
4. Foot traffic:
    - NYC OpenData "Bi-Annual Pedestrian Counts" don't provide enough information; only 114 locations in all of NYC.
    -Placemeter's data is a single snapshot from [November 2013](http://www.nyc.gov/html/analytics/html/misc/definitions.html) and raw data is not available.
