According to our notes, the following things matter in creating a safety score:

- Lighting
- Eyes on the street - open businesses, residences, cameras, etc.
- Historic crime data
- Foot traffic
- What's the average wait time for transportation arrival?
- Is the waiting area obscured from public view?
- What kind of street furniture is provided?
- How often is the area patrolled by public safety officers?

So, where can we get data on how to quanitfy these things?
