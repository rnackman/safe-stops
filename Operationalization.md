According to our notes, the following things matter in creating a safety score:

1. Lighting
2. Eyes on the street - open businesses, residences, cameras, etc.
    - Business License filings https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Legally-Operating-Businesses/w7w3-xahh
    
3. Historic crime data
4. Foot traffic
5. What's the average wait time for transportation arrival?
6. Is the waiting area obscured from public view?
7. What kind of street furniture is provided?
8. How often is the area patrolled by public safety officers?
