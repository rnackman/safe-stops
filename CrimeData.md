There are some issues with the crime data, namely that "rape and sex crimes are not geocoded." Instead, the crime location is reported at the precinct level.  What this means for us is that our unit of analysis may not be as fined grained as we had hope, i.e. the bus stop level.  Instead, we may instead have to use hierarchical data.  Another issue with the crime data is that "many" other crimes were not geocoded and are defaulted to the police station house withing a given precinct.  Both of these issues will result in artifically high crime rates for bus stops located near police stations.  This is likely to generate an ecological fallacy.
